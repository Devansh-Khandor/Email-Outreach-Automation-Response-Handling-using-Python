## **Setup & Usage**  

### **üîß Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-outreach-automation.git
   cd email-outreach-automation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```
3. Replace placeholders with actual **email credentials** (**Use environment variables for security**).  
4. Update **Excel file paths** with your dataset.  
5. Run the script:
